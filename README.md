wallPi
======

A wallboard distro designed for the Raspberry Pi.

Goal
----
Create a basic wallboard distribution for a RasberryPi. The intention is to provide a single window browser that is started up in fullscreen connecting to a URL which provides your wallboard information.

Intention
---------
Provide a web interface for setting a web URL for the default browser to connect to as well as allow basic restart buttons to prevent the need to actually change anything on the Pi itself.

What it won't do
----------------
The intention is not to provide an application for displaying information but rather to provide a browser that will render whatever you require. This means that the web service needs to be running on another host somewhere on a network (web or local).
